| Should GnosisDAO establish OWL as a stablecoin? | Product/Meta | [Discuss](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/should-gnosisdao-establish-owl-as-a-stable-coin/1088) |

Summary:\
OWL is one of the most undervalued assets Gnosis has. Currently its role seems fuzzy and the potential of OWL is not used at all.

This proposal suggests to morph OWL into an asset backed stable coin - similar to DAI.

| GPv2 Road to decentralization | Product/Meta | [Discuss](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gpv2-road-to-decentralization/1245) |

Summary:\
Our team has been heads down building the smart contracts, a first swap interface and solver infrastructure for Gnosis Protocol v2 (GPv2) in the last couple of months.

As we are getting closer to a beta launch, weâ€™d like to share with you some of the compromises we made for our initial version in terms of decentralization and how we are going to address them going forward as we find adoption and validate the general product idea.
